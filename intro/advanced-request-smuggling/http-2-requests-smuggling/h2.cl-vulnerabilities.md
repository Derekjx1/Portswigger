# H2.CL vulnerabilities

HTTP/2 doesn't require `content-length` headers to be set, downgrading would mean frontend servers would need to specify it in the request usually from the value set in HTTP/2 built in mechanism.

RFC specifications states that the `content-length`header that is added must match the value calculated by HTTP/2 built in mechanism however, due to improper validation HTTP request smuggling may be possible using a misleading content-length header value leading to the desync.

Here, the backend will still use the content-length header that is specified in our request and when it sees this that the content-length is 0 it will assume that there is no content body and treat it as it has ended which leaves our smuggled request unprocessed. Thus when regular request is sent right after, it will be appended to the request.
