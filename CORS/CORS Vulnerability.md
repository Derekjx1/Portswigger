# What is CORS?

Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing(CORS) is a browser functionality to allow controlled access to load third party resources other than its web application domain. It extends functionality to Same-origin policy which is used to restrict access.
However, if misconfigured, it gives potential for cross domain attacks.

This is usually controlled at the client or browser side, but its primarily a server side misconfiguration as CORS restrictions are imposed by the server and the client merely enforces this by allowing or dropping requests.
